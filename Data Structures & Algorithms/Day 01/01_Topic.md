# Day 01 ‚Äì Introduction to Programming

Welcome to Day 1 of my 180 Days of DSA journey!  
Today‚Äôs focus was on understanding how computers and programming evolved, and laying the foundation for future learning.

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered with Descriptions

### 1. Evolution of Number Systems
- Humans started with simple tally systems for counting.
- With time, numeric systems developed to represent complex quantities.
- The base-10 system, also known as the decimal system, was developed by Indian mathematicians.
- Modern computing relies on the Binary Number System (0s and 1s).

### 2. Invention of Computers
- The development of computers began with mechanical calculators.
- Electronic computers were invented using transistors, revolutionizing speed and size.

### 3. Transistors & Their Importance
- A transistor is a tiny electronic switch used to control electrical signals.
- More transistors = more power and faster computing.

### 4. Binary & Other Number Systems
- Binary ‚Äì Base-2 system used by all modern computers.
- Decimal ‚Äì Base-10 system used by humans.
- Octal ‚Äì Base-8 system (early computing).
- Hexadecimal ‚Äì Base-16 system (compact binary representation).
- Conversion between these systems was practiced.

### 5. Moore‚Äôs Law (1965)
> "The number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years."

This explains why computers become faster and more capable over time.

### 6. Evolution of Programming Languages
- Programming started at the Machine Level (binary).
- Then came Assembly Language (low-level instructions).
- Now we use High-Level Languages (like C++, Java, Python).
> Speed Order: Machine Level >> Assembly >> High-Level

### 7. Introduction to the Internet
- Brief history and purpose of the internet.
- A global network connecting computers for data sharing and communication.

## üß† Analogy for Understanding Programming Levels  

| Aspect                  | Guddu Bhaiya                             | Bablu Bhaiya                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Task                    | Sum of 100 natural numbers               | Sum of 100 natural numbers              |
| Approach                | Add manually: 1 + 2 + ... + 100        | Use formula: n(n + 1)/2               |
| Time Taken              | ~20 minutes                              | Instant result                          |
| Output                  | 5050 (but slower)                        | 5050 (efficient)                        |
| Speed                   | Slow                                     | Fast                                    |
| Accuracy                | Risk of manual error                     | Formula-based, more accurate            |
| Programming Level       | Manual / Brute-force                     | Optimized / High-level thinking         |
| Real-Life Analogy       | ‚ÄúPower but less planning‚Äù                | ‚ÄúSmart and strategic‚Äù                   |
