# 📘 Day 136 - Introduction to Graphs

Graphs are an essential data structure used to represent relationships between entities. In a graph, nodes (or vertices) represent the objects, and edges represent the connections between them.

## ✅ Why Learn Graphs?

- 🌐 Real-world modeling: Maps, networks, social media, etc.
- 💼 Important in coding interviews (traversals, shortest path, MST, etc.)
- 🤖 Applications in AI, ML, networking, databases, and OS

## 🔤 Terminologies:

| Term        | Description                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Vertex      | A node or point in a graph                            |
| Edge        | A connection between two nodes                        |
| Degree      | Number of edges connected to a vertex                 |
| Adjacent    | Two vertices connected by an edge                     |

## 🧱 Types of Graphs:

- 🔁 Directed vs Undirected
- ⚖️ Weighted vs Unweighted
- ♻️ Cyclic vs Acyclic
- 🔗 Connected vs Disconnected
- 🧩 Complete Graph

## 🛠️ Graph Representation:

1. Adjacency Matrix – 2D array (good for dense graphs)
2. Adjacency List – Array of lists or HashMap (space-efficient)
3. Edge List – Just a list of edges (useful in Kruskal’s Algo)

## 💡 Applications of Graphs:

- 🚗 GPS Navigation – Dijkstra's/A* for shortest path
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social Networks – Finding mutual friends, communities
- 🔍 Web Crawlers – DFS/BFS for link traversal
- 📡 Network Routing – Packet delivery using graphs
- 🤖 AI Search Algorithms – Used in pathfinding, game logic
